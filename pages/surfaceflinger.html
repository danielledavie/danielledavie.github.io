<h2>SurfaceFlinger and WindowManager</h3>

<p>SurfaceFlinger accepts buffers, composes buffers, and sends buffers to the
display. WindowManager provides SurfaceFlinger with buffers and  window
metadata, which SurfaceFlinger uses to composite surfaces to the display.</p>

<h2 id="surfaceflinger">SurfaceFlinger</h2>

<p>SurfaceFlinger can accept buffers in two ways: through BufferQueue and
SurfaceControl, or through ASurfaceControl.</p>

<p>One way SurfaceFlinger accepts buffers is through BufferQueue and
SurfaceControl. When an app comes to the foreground, it requests buffers from
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.html"
class="external">WindowManager</a>. WindowManager then requests a layer from
SurfaceFlinger. A layer is a combination of a <a
href="/devices/graphics/arch-sh">surface</a>, which contains the BufferQueue, and
a <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceControl"
     class="external">SurfaceControl</a>, which contains the layer metadata like the display frame.
SurfaceFlinger creates the layer and sends it to WindowManager. WindowManager
then sends the surface to the app, but keeps the SurfaceControl to
manipulate the appearance of the app on the screen.</p>

<p>Android 10 adds ASurfaceControl, which is another
way that SurfaceFlinger can accept buffers.
ASurfaceControl combines a surface
and a SurfaceControl into one transaction package that is sent to
SurfaceFlinger. An ASurfaceControl is associated with a layer, which apps
update through ASurfaceTransactions. Apps then get information about
ASurfaceTransactions through callbacks that pass ASurfaceTransactionStats
containing information, such as latch time, acquire times, and so on.</p>

<p>The following table includes more details about ASurfaceControl and its
associated components.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ASurfaceControl</td>
    <td>Wraps SurfaceControl and enables an app to create SurfaceControls that
      correspond to layers on the display.<br /><br />Can be created as a child of
      ANativeWindow or as a child of another ASurfaceControl.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ASurfaceTransaction</td>
    <td>Wraps Transaction to enable the client to edit a layer's descriptive
      properties, such as geometry, and sends the updated buffers to
      SurfaceFlinger.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ASurfaceTransactionStats</td>
    <td>Sends information about transactions that have been presented, such as
      latch time, acquire times, and previous release fence, to an app through a
      preregistered callback.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Though apps can submit buffers at any time, SurfaceFlinger only wakes up to
accept buffers between display refreshes, which can differ depending on the
device. This minimizes memory usage and avoids visible tearing on the
screen, which can occur when updating the display mid-refresh.</p>

<p>When the display is between refreshes, the display sends the <em>VSYNC</em>
signal to SurfaceFlinger. The VSYNC signal indicates that the display can be
refreshed without tearing. When SurfaceFlinger receives the VSYNC signal, SurfaceFlinger
walks through its list of layers looking for new buffers. If SurfaceFlinger finds a
new buffer, SurfaceFlinger acquires the buffer; if not, SurfaceFlinger continues
to use the previously acquired buffer. SurfaceFlinger must always display something,
so it hangs on to one buffer. If no buffers have ever been submitted on a
layer, the layer is ignored.</p>

<p>After SurfaceFlinger has collected all buffers for visible layers, it asks
the Hardware Composer (HWC) how composition should be performed. If the HWC
marks layer composition type as client composition, SurfaceFlinger composites those
layers. Then, SurfaceFlinger passes the output buffer to the <a
href="/devices/graphics/implement-hwc">HWC</a>.</p>

<h2 id="windowmanager">WindowManager</h2>

<p>WindowManager controls <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window"
class="external">window</a> objects, which are containers for <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View"
class="external">view</a> objects. Window objects are always backed by
surface objects. WindowManager oversees lifecycles, input and focus
events, screen orientation, transitions, animations, position, transforms,
z-order, and many other aspects of a window. WindowManager sends all of the
window metadata to SurfaceFlinger so SurfaceFlinger can use that data to
composite surfaces on the display.</p>

<h3 id="pre-rotation">Pre-rotation</h3>

<p>Many hardware overlays don't support rotation (and even if they do, it costs
processing power); the solution is to transform the buffer before it reaches
SurfaceFlinger. Android supports a query hint
(<code translate="no" dir="ltr">NATIVE_WINDOW_TRANSFORM_HINT</code>) in <code translate="no" dir="ltr">ANativeWindow</code> to
represent the most likely transform to be applied to the buffer by
SurfaceFlinger. GL drivers can use this hint to pre-transform the buffer
before it reaches SurfaceFlinger so that when the buffer arrives, it's correctly
transformed.</p>

<p>For example, when receiving a hint to rotate 90 degrees, generate and apply a
matrix to the buffer to prevent it from running off the end of the page. To save
power, do this pre-rotation. For details, see the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">ANativeWindow</code>
interface defined in <code translate="no" dir="ltr">system/core/include/system/window.h</code>.</p>
